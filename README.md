# Plagiarism-Detection-Model
## 1. Introduction 
The main objective of this project is to use a combination of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Natural processing Language (NPL) techniques to develop a robust plagiarism detection model to combat the increasing issues of plagiarism in the academic sector.

2. Open this link and go back to the folder.
3. This will allow us to link between Dataset and Google Colab.

## 3. Why this Dataset? 
The dataset was designed to test and develop systems capable of detecting plagiarism, especially in educational settings. It consists of short answer texts collected to form a controlled environment where plagiarism is known and can be quantitatively assessed. The figure below shows the different tasks and plagiarism categories per text file.

## 5. Results
This model achieved an accuracy score of 95% with a precision, recall, and f1-score of 100%, 88%, and 93%, respectively. The Decision Tree model demonstrated strong performance with a 95% accuracy rate. It achieved perfect precision, indicating no false positives, but its 88% recall suggests some actual plagiarism cases were missed. The f1-score of 93% reflects high accuracy and precision in its predictions. However, improvements could be made in detecting all positive cases, as shown in the confusion matrix with few misclassifications.
